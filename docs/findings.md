# Performance Analysis and Findings

## Latest Performance Analysis

### Silent Mode (Best Performance)
- Total batches: 17,126 in 30s (~571 batches/s)
- Network throughput: 2.07MB/s
- Network time: ~11s per node
- Memory usage: 770.45MB
- Default compression ratio: 1.88x
- Distribution: 1,458-2,008 batches per node

### Impact of Logging Modes
