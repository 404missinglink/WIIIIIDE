# Performance Analysis and Findings

## Performance Analysis Across Different Configurations

### Standard Configuration (Best Performance)
- Total batches: 13,764 in 30s (~459 batches/s)
- Network throughput: 1.67MB/s
- Network time: ~14s per node
- Memory usage: 755.39MB
- Default compression ratio: 1.88x (pickle/zlib)
- Even distribution: 1,196-1,617 batches per node

### With Additional Compression
- Total batches: 10,339 in 30s (~344 batches/s)
- Network throughput: 834.88KB/s
- Network time: ~12.7s per node
