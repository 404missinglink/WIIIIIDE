## What Didn't Work

1. **Non-Blocking Socket Attempts**
   - Full non-blocking mode caused connection issues
   - Complex error handling added overhead
   - Benefits didn't outweigh the complexity
   - Solution: Use blocking mode with selective non-blocking for connections

2. **Aggressive Compression**
   - Higher compression ratios (>1.88x) increased CPU usage
   - Compression level 9 for all data was too slow
   - Memory usage increased with larger compression buffers
   - Solution: Adaptive compression based on data size

3. **Small Buffer Sizes**
   - 1MB buffers were insufficient
   - 16MB buffers didn't show additional benefit over 8MB
   - Very small chunks (<64KB) increased system calls
   - Solution: 8MB buffers with 256KB chunks optimal

4. **Logging Overhead**
   - Verbose logging reduced throughput by 24%
   - Debug-level logging in production was costly
   - Real-time metrics impacted performance
   - Solution: Three-tier logging system (silent, normal, verbose)

## Historical Performance Data

### Logging Impact Study
- Verbose mode: 1.67MB/s throughput
- Normal mode: 1.85MB/s throughput
- Silent mode: 2.07MB/s throughput
- Memory impact: minimal (~2MB difference)

### Buffer Size Testing
1. **1MB Buffers**
   - Throughput: 1.2MB/s

   - Optimal performance
   - Best stability

4. **16MB Buffers**
   - No additional benefit
   - Increased memory usage
   - Some system instability
