# Optimizations and Performance Improvements

## Latest Performance Breakthroughs

### Logging Optimization
```python
# Reduced logging overhead by implementing three modes
if log_mode == "1":  # Silent (default)
    logging.getLogger('w5xde').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
elif log_mode == "2":  # Normal
    logging.getLogger('w5xde').setLevel(logging.WARNING)
else:  # Verbose
    logging.getLogger('w5xde').setLevel(logging.INFO)
```
**Impact:**
- Silent mode: 2.07MB/s throughput (24% increase)
- 17,126 batches/30s (25% increase)
- Minimal memory overhead (770MB vs 754MB)
- Network time reduced from ~14s to ~11s per node

### Socket Buffer Optimization
```python
def configure_socket(sock):
    # Increased buffer sizes to 4MB
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_RCVBUF, 4 * 1024 * 1024)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_SNDBUF, 4 * 1024 * 1024)
    
    # TCP optimizations
    sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_NODELAY, 1)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_TCP, socket.TCP_QUICKACK, 1)
```
**Impact:**
- 4x larger buffer size
- ~15% reduction in network operation time
- More consistent throughput across nodes

### Chunk Size Optimization
```python
def recvall(sock, n):
    chunk_size = min(64 * 1024, n)  # 64KB chunks
    while pos < n:
        received = sock.recv_into(view[pos:pos + chunk_size])
```
**Impact:**
- Better memory utilization
- More efficient network reads
- Reduced system calls
